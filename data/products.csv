102,8904,600,₦500,,false,"1"" Plug","A 1-inch plug is a small, threaded fitting used to close off the end of a pipe, typically in plumbing systems. It is most commonly applied when a pipe opening is no longer needed or when it's being sealed temporarily for future use. These plugs are manufactured from materials like brass, galvanized steel, stainless steel, and PVC, depending on the type of piping and its application. The plug features male threads that screw into a female-threaded pipe or fitting, forming a tight seal that prevents leaks. In residential and commercial plumbing, 1-inch plugs are frequently found in water supply systems, irrigation networks, or areas designated for maintenance access.","1plug2-removebg-preview.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/46/46/1761127200000/05kml3oRukzfLOzUxxmRAA/90jBUtGmf_iYNuyATRFu4T71RjpoCx8sm6jSNr9_7Xk1KU1SJIV_TdewkEAypTGZiosJNHlRfTLAQWdXw_ikVj9fu1sZX4E_Nkn9Ys3LuO2wvZIfvzb1vOi_yOt1yaI3xLkpHsjyOyDcBSuXuQeMUltXb26tpEaM19tYSwoEW4_Fnk_RW8eR69BQ8mkyLN0H/YxF5r2UGygDDQO0zlc7h-0LZ9IoNfO1SA_l3RjOjcCg),1plu-removebg-preview.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/46/46/1761127200000/yWqTQ8ZyO8j0MgZ7_JOVCg/AbiYQDxX4_BNWcKCL_Do5XVNG_IJVHdgKQVCa38njHUaMO7Zas-MvKllfoS8vlmvPMp8G5_CAe91dnXpWn58i3hveECV82sbrg2gjBB6PdAeQufnan6vH8RmcLPi3pQ8kKH5Wz9WvNqYGvVjLrq5aljcBKQ4Z2X5FU4PnX_ELlo/ff5B7-sGNFi1IH9O4SoXO6Z6iK785uu3K7YRdbQ6WHE)",,P.V.C Fittings,P.V.C Fittings,,,,

By manipulating contrast and light, the filter draws the viewer's eye to the brightest elements, which often appear to glow against the dark backdrop. This technique is particularly effective for portraits, landscapes, and still life, where the emphasis is on form, texture, and light rather than vibrant color. The Black Candle filter is not merely about darkening a photo; it's a deliberate artistic choice to transform a scene into a piece that feels both timeless and otherworldly.
